What requirements did you achieve?
4/4 basic requirements and 3/5 strech requirements, I also made sure the appearance transferred to mobile view.

Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?


If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?


What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
I struggled with putting my footer on top of another section, I'm still fairly weak on the box model but I think I got there in the end.
I found moving my text, headings and logo around then caused other items to do unusally things (e.g. my background image didn't cover the full background when viewed in mobile view when I was trying to move the text further left)

Resources used and for what topics I read about: 
Code Academy - margin and paddding
W3 Schools - making the first-letter larger
Peer support (Joe G) - background images being blurry (I was using low resolution images, coding was ok)
Digital Ocean and W3 Schools - padding for the text and buttons including hover function
W3 Docs and Stack Overflow - Anchor names and the top of the page only needing '#'
